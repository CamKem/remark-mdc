# Remark MDC

Remark plugin to parse MarkDown Components syntax.

## Setup


Add `remark-mdc` dependency to your project:

::code-group
```bash [Yarn]
yarn add --dev remark-mdc
```
```bash [NPM]
npm install --save-dev remark-mdc
```
```bash [PNPM]
pnpm i --save-dev remark-mdc
```
::

Then, add `remark-mdc` to the `unified` streams:

```ts 
import { unified } from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkMDC from 'remark-mdc'

function parse(md: string) {
  const processor = unified()
  processor.use(remarkParse)

  // Use `remark-mdc` plugin to parse mdc syntax
  processor.use(remarkMDC)

  // ...

  return processor.process({ value: content, data: frontmatter })
}
```

That's it âœ¨

## Syntax

### `^-` Frontmatter

Front-matter is a convention of Markdown-based CMS to provide meta-data to documents, like description or title. Remark MDc uses the YAML syntax with `key: value` pairs.

To define frontmatter, start your document with `---\n---` section and put your desired data in yaml format within this section.

```md
---
title: 'Title of the page'
description: 'meta description of the page'
---

<!-- Content of the page -->
```

### `:` Inline Components
Inline components are entiries that will stick inside parent paragraph. Like spans, emojis, icons, etc. Inline component can be defined by single `:` followed by component name.

```md
A simple :inline-component
```

You may want to pass some text into an inline-component, you can do it using `[TEXT]` syntax

```md
A simple :inline-component[John Doe]
```

If you want to use an inline component followed by specific characters like `-`, `_` or `:`, you can use a dummy props specifier after it.

```md
How to say :hello{}-world in markdown
```


In this example, `:hello{}` will search for the `<Hello />` component, and `-world` will be plain text.

::alert
Note: If you put an inline component alone in a single line it will be transformed to a block component. This is suger syntax for block components.
```md
Paragraph a

:block-component

Pargraph b
```
::

### `::` Block Components

Block components are components that accept Markdown content or another component as a slot.

Block components defined by `::` identifier.

```md
::card
The content of the card
::
```

Block component can be used without any content.

```md
::card
::
```

Or with suger syntax. Note that in suger syntax it is important to put the component alone in a separate line

```md
A paragraph

:card
```

### `#` Slots

Block components can accept slots (like vue slots) with different names. The content of these slots can be anything from normal markdown paragraph to a nested block component.

- The `default` slot renders the top-level content inside the block component.
- Named slots use the `#` identifier to render the corresponding content.

```md
::hero
Default slot text

#description
This will be rendered inside the `description` slot.
```

### `:::` Nesting

MDC supports nested components inside slots by indenting them. In order to make nested components visually distinguishable, you can indend nested components and add more `:` when you define them.

```md
::hero
  :::card
    A nested card

    ::::card
      A super nested card
    ::::
  :::
::
```

### `[]` Span

To create inline spans in your text you can use the `[]` identifier.

```md
Hello [World]
```

This syntax is usefull in combination of inline props to make text visually different from rest of paragraph. Checkout inline props section to read more about props.

```md
Hello [World]{.bg-blue-500}!
```

### `{}` Inline Props

Using the inline props syntax you can pass props and attributes to your components. Also you MDC goes goes a step further and allows you to pass attributes to markdown native elements like images, links, bold texts and etc.

In order to define properties for a component or a markdown element, You need to create props scope `{}` exactly after the component/element definition. Then you can define the properties inline this scope using a `key=value` syntax.

```md
Inline :component{key="value" key2=value2}

::block-component{no-border title="My Component"}
::

[Link](https://nuxt.com){class="nuxt"}

![Nuxt Logo](https://nuxt.com/assets/design-kit/logo/icon-green.svg){class=".nuxt-logo"}

`code`{style="color: red"}

_italic_{style="color: blue"}

**bold**{style="color: blue"}
```

There is also couple of suger syntaxes for common use-cases:

- `id` attribute: `_italic_{#the_italic_text}`
- `class` attribute: `**bold**{.bold .text.with_attribute}`
- No value (boolean props): `:component{no-border}`
- Single string without any space: `**bold**{class=red}`

If you want to pass arrays or objects as props to components you can pass them as JSON string and prefix the prop key with a colon to automatically decode the JSON string. Note that in this case you should use single quotes for the value string so you can use double quotes to pass a valid JSON string:

```md
::dropdown{:items='["Nuxt", "Vue", "React"]'}
String Array
::

::dropdown{:items='[1,2,3.5]'}
Number Array
::

::chart{:options='{"responsive": true, "scales": {"y": {"beginAtZero": true}}}'}
Object
::
```

### `---` Yaml Props

The YAML method uses the `---` identifier to declare one prop per line, that can be useful for readability.

```md
::icon-card
---
icon: IconNuxt
description: Harness the full power of Nuxt and the Nuxt ecosystem.
title: Nuxt Architecture.
---
::
```
